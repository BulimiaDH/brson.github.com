  If you want to contact me please send email: to banderson@mozilla.com,
  for Rust matters; or andersrb@gmail.com, for personal matters or job
  offers. I am also often available on Mozilla's IRC network as
  "brson". Other methods of contact are almost certain to not get my
  attention, including GitHub pings.
