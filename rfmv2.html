<h2>About this document</h2>
<p>As New-Reddit has rolled out, people have often noted differences in
how content is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing">parsed</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendering_(computer_graphics)">rendered</a> between &quot;legacy&quot; Reddit and New
Reddit. Content on Reddit - comments, self-posts, and otherwise - is
represented as a Reddit-specific variation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> format,
and that format has changed in New-Reddit.</p>
<p>This is a guide to Reddit-flavored Markdown, explaining generally how
to format comments on New-Reddit, and specifically identifying areas
where New-Reddit-flavored Markdown is different from Legacy
Reddit-flavored markdown.</p>
<p>Within, examples are presented as pairs showing first how the Markdown
is <strong>written</strong> in the editor, then as it is <strong>rendered</strong>, or presented
on the screen. Important <em>New-Reddit notes</em> about differences between New
Reddit-flavored Markdown and Legacy Reddit-flavored markdown are
called out in italicized paragraphs marked with the flour-de-lis (‚öúÔ∏è),
and general <em>tips</em> with the crystal ball (üîÆ).</p>
<p>For more technical details see <a href="#md">&quot;More about Markdown in Reddit&quot;</a>,
and <a href="#diff">&quot;Differences between Legacy Reddit, New-Reddit, and
CommonMark&quot;</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the content of this document is lifted directly from the
previous work of others. See <a href="#cred">&quot;Credits and further reading&quot;</a> for

<pre><code>People think a soul mate is your perfect fit, and that's what
everyone wants. But a true soul mate is a mirror, the person who shows
you everything that is holding you back, the person who brings you to
your own attention so you can change your life.

A true soul mate is probably the most important person you'll ever
meet, because they tear down your walls and smack you awake. But to
live with a soul mate forever? Nah. Too painful. Soul mates, they come
into your life just to reveal another layer of yourself to you, and
then leave.

A soul mate's purpose is to shake you up, tear apart your ego a
little bit, show you your obstacles and addictions, break your heart
open so new light can get in, make you so desperate and out of control
that you have to transform your life, then introduce you to your
spiritual master...

<a id="hb"/>
<p>Note that <em>line breaks</em> are not displayed - that is, adjacent lines are
concatenated together to create a single paragraph. Line breaks can be
added explitly by ending lines with a backslash (&quot;\&quot;), or with two
spaces.</p>
<p><strong>Written</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing\
and rightdoing there is a field.\
I'll meet you there.

<p>Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing<br />

We are only pieces.

<p><strong>Rendered</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Love is the whole thing.<br />

</blockquote>
<p>‚öúÔ∏è <em><strong>New-Reddit note</strong>: Creating linebreaks with backslash only works in
new Reddit. While the backslash is clearer to read and write than two
spaces, if you need compatibility with Legacy Reddit, prefer two
spaces.</em></p>
<p>Paragraphs are separated by any number of blank lines, and those blank
lines are not themselves rendered, thus one can't add an arbitrary
amount of space between paragraphs simply by adding extra blank lines.</p>
<p><strong>Written</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>Be empty of worrying.\

<h3>Basic text formatting</h3>
<p><em>Italic</em> text is represented by surrounding text with either a single asterisk (<code>*</code>) or underscore (<code>_</code>).</p>
<p><strong>Written</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>It is *error* only, and not _truth_, that shrinks from inquiry
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Rendered</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is <em>error</em> only, and not <em>truth</em>, that shrinks from inquiry</p>

<p><em>Bold</em> text is represented by surrounding text with either double asterisks (<code>**</code>) or double underscores (<code>__</code>).</p>
<p><strong>Written</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>It is **error** only, and not __truth__, that shrinks from inquiry
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Rendered</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is <strong>error</strong> only, and not <strong>truth</strong>, that shrinks from inquiry</p>

<a id="strike"/>
<p><em>Strikethrough</em> text is represented by surrounding text with double tildes (<code>~~</code>).</p>
<p><strong>Written</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>

<p><strong>Rendered</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to
^reddit and be ^reddited in return.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>‚öúÔ∏è <em><strong>New-Reddit note</strong>: There are significant differences in the parsing
of superscript between Legacy Reddit and New-Reddit. Legacy Reddit in
particular often failed to parse the parethnesized superscript syntax
reasonably. And New-Reddit does not (yet) support multiple levels of
superscript.</em></p>
<p>üîÆ <em><strong>Tip</strong>: For superscript compatibility between Legacy and
New-Reddit, stick to the single-word, unparenthesized superscript syntax
and superscript every word, or alternately separate words with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space">&quot;non-breaking space&quot;</a> HTML entities (<code>&amp;nbsp;</code>).</em></p>

<h3>Links</h3>
<a id="rlinks"/>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL">URLs</a> beginning with &quot;http://&quot;, &quot;https://&quot;, or &quot;www.&quot; are
automatically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink">hyperlinked</a>, as are subreddit names (&quot;/r/rust&quot;,
&quot;r/rust&quot;), and user names (&quot;/u/spez&quot; and &quot;u/spez&quot;). The latter are
known as &quot;redditlinks&quot; and &quot;userlinks&quot;. Collectively these are known
as &quot;autolinks&quot;.</p>

<p>üîÆ <em><strong>Tip</strong>: Complex URLs can parse in unexpected ways as
autolinks. When you find a URL isn't linking correctly, you can
instead surround the link with angled brackets (<code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>).</em></p>
<p><strong>Written</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>&lt;http://example.com/foo/../bar..&gt;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Rendered</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://example.com/foo/../bar..">http://example.com/foo/../bar..</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Arbitrary text can be explicitly hyperlinked by surrounding it with
square brackets, followed by a URL in parenthesis. The link can
optionally be given a &quot;title&quot;, which is typically shown by the browser
when the user hovers their mouse over the link.</p>
<p>The title must be surrounded by single quotes, double quotes, or
parenthesis.</p>

<p>Links my also be defined as &quot;references&quot;, outside of the paragraph.</p>

<p>By default the reference name is the same as the text in brackets, but
the reference can be named explicitly within a second set of brackets,

<p>üîÆ <em><strong>Tip</strong>: Note that links can only contain parentheses if

parenthesis with backslash (&quot;\&quot;), or use the alternate linking syntax,
enclosing the URL in matched angle brackets, &quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot;.</em></p>

<p>‚öúÔ∏è <em><strong>New-Reddit note</strong>: Using &quot;)&quot; to delimit ordered lists only works

<p>On Reddit, ordered lists must start with &quot;1&quot;.</p>
<p>Besides the numbering, unordered and ordered lists are otherwise
generaly parsed the same, so the remaining examples will use unordered
lists for simplicity.</p>
<p>Each individual entry in a list is called an <em>item</em>. Items can have
any amount of space between them. Adding space can make complex list
items more readable while editing.</p>

<h2>Blockquotes</h2>
<p><em>Blockquotes</em> are a way to quote large amount of text (and Markdown).
They are created by beginning a line with a right pointy-bracket
(<code>&gt;</code>).</p>
<p><strong>Written</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>&gt; It's so hard to forget pain, but it's even harder to
remember sweetness. We have no scar to show for happiness.
We learn so little from peace.

</blockquote>
<p>For simple quotes it's sufficient just to begin the first line of a
paragraph with <code>&gt;</code>, as above, and the whole thing will be blockquoted.</p>
<p>For more complex blockquotes, precede every line with <code>&gt;</code>.</p>

<h3>Escaping Markdown syntax</h3>
<p><em>Escaping</em> is a way to tell the parser not to interpret special
characters as Markdown, by preceding them with a backslash, (<code>\</code>).</p>
<p>Sometimes one finds that the parser has interpreted their text in a
way that was unintended. This can happen, for example, if, in the
middle of a paragraph a hyphen begins a new line.</p>
<p><strong>Written</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>I felt my lungs inflate with the onrush of scenery
- air, mountains, trees, people. I thought,
&quot;This is what it is to be happy.
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Rendered</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I felt my lungs inflate with the onrush of scenery</p>
<ul>
<li>air, mountains, trees, people. I thought,
&quot;This is what it is to be happy.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In this case the dash is meant to be part of the text, not the start
of a list. Escaping the dash with a backslash fixes the problem.</p>
<p><strong>Written</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>I felt my lungs inflate with the onrush of scenery
\- air, mountains, trees, people. I thought,
&quot;This is what it is to be happy.
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Rendered</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I felt my lungs inflate with the onrush of scenery
- air, mountains, trees, people. I thought,
&quot;This is what it is to be happy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another common case where the need to escape arises in
with parentheses in links.</p>
<p><strong>Written</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[Parenthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/))
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Rendered</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/">Parenthesis</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is supposed to be a link to the Wikipedia article about
parentheses (&quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/</a>)&quot;), but instead it's a
link to &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/</a>&quot;. Escaping the parenthesis in
the URL causes the parser to not treat it as the closing parethesis of
the link syntax.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[Parenthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\))
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Rendered</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/)">Parenthesis</a></p>

<h3>Tips for robots</h3>
<p>During the transition we've seen some incompatibility arise in the
syntax bots were using. Here are some notes from those experiences, as
well as some general info about automatic posting of Markdown.</p>
<p>This section could use help from bot authors.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In links don't put spaces between the text (<code>[...]</code>) and the URL
(<code>(http://example.com)</code>). This worked in old-Reddit but not
New-Reddit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Backslash-escape all parentheses in link URLs (not autolinks), like
<code>[text](http://example.com/foo\(bar)</code>. Parentheses must be balanced
or they will not be parsed as links, so simply escaping all
parentheses is sufficient to make all links with parentheses parse
correctly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternately, use the pointy bracket syntax for link URLs
(<code>[text](&lt;http://example.com&gt;)</code>, which accept unbalanced parens. In
this case though you must URL-escape pointy brackets, as <code>%3C</code> and
<code>%3E</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you post autolinks (raw URLs without the bracket syntax),
consider surrounding them in pointy brackets (<code>&lt;</code> <code>&gt;</code>) and
URL-escaping any pointy brackets within as <code>%3C</code> and <code>%3E</code>. This
will prevent any ambiguity in parsing, particularly at the end of
autolinks. Note that even within brackets autolinks cannot contain
spaces, so URL-escape them as <code>%20</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There's just no way to get away from escaping <em>something</em> while
posting arbitrary links as a bot if you want all URLs to be parsed
as expected. Details of link parsing are <a href="http://commonmark.org/">in the spec</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The new parser and old parser treat HTML-escapes (ala <code>&amp;nbsp;</code>)
differently - the old one preserves them, in both text and links;
the new one unescapes them during parsing so that clients (many of
which are not web browsers) aren't exposed to them. This is true
both in text and links, and is specified as such by CommonMark.</p>
<p>The implications of this for bots aren't clear to me at this time,
and I have no recommendations.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reddit-flavored Markdown compatibility recommendations</h2>
<p>These are a few recommendations for writing Markdown that is
compatible with Legacy Reddit markdown parsing (so long as the legacy
parser remains in production).</p>
<p>Some of the recommendatations are &quot;easy&quot; because they have
equivalents that are as-good in Old-Reddit; some are &quot;unfortunate&quot;
because they favor less-nice syntax in sake of compatibility.</p>
<p>Presumably the old parser will be phased out completely at some point
(today it is only used on the old web client - mobile clients use the
new), and these recommendations can change.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you don't care about formatting on Old-Reddit,
then go ahead and do the opposite of all these suggestions.</p>
<h3>Easy compatibilty recommendations</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use quotes for link titles like <code>[text](http://example.com &quot;title&quot;)</code>
(as opposed to parentheses for link titles).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Begin and end table columns with pipe characters (<code>|</code>). They are
technically optional, but there are occassional surpise parses when
they are not used.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Unfortunate compatibility recommendations</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use double spaces instead of backslash to indicate hard line breaks.
Old-Reddit only supports double spaces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use indented code blocks instead of code fences. Old-Reddit only
supports indented code blocks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't use nested emphasis like <code>_this is __really__ important_</code>.
Doesn't work in Old-Reddit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't use multiple levels of superscript (aka &quot;towers&quot;). Doesn't
work in New-Reddit, at least not yet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continue using common 'hacks' to make superscript support spaces
like superscripting every word or joining them with exotic unicode
space characters. Avoid the parethesized superscript syntax,
<code>^(...)</code> - it often is misparsed in Old-Reddit.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>More about Markdown at Reddit</h2>
<p>New-Reddit's markdown parser, snoomark, is a variation of
<a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/">GitHub-flavored Markdown (GFM)</a>, based on <a href="http://commonmark.org/">CommonMark</a>, with the
GFM table and autolink extensions, as well as a modified
strikethrough extension. It also includes Reddit-specific extensions,
and Reddit-specific compatibility quirks that deviate from CommonMark.</p>
<p>snoomark is a downstream project of <a href="https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak">comrak</a>, which is in turn a
re-implementation of <a href="https://github.com/github/cmark">cmark-gfm</a>, GitHub's CommonMark implementation
with GitHub extensions (GFM), which is in turn downstream of <a href="https://github.com/commonmark/cmark">cmark</a>,
the CommonMark reference implementation. snoomark itself is not (yet)
open source, but changes to comrak are regularly merged into snoomark.</p>
<p>During the transition from Legacy Reddit to New-Reddit, the philosophy
around Markdown support has fluctuated - originally, the plan was to
move to something approaching CommonMark and drop all compatibility
with legacy Reddit &quot;quirks&quot;; but as the rollout proceeded, and without
and firm transition story, that position softened, and a number of
compatibility quirks were added to the new parser.</p>
<p>At this time it is not expected that many further compatibility quirks
will be added to New-Reddit: it's more likely that the legacy parser
will be completely removed in favor of the new parser, leaving both
Legacy Reddit and New-Reddit using the new syntax. In that scenario,
there will be some amount (hopefully small) of legacy content that no
longer renders correctly due to parsing differences.</p>
<p>Future directions though will continue to be evaluated as the rollout
continues and bugs are reported.</p>
<p>Markdown rendering in New-Reddit is notably different from Legacy
Reddit, and from most Markdowwn-consuming websites, in that it is not
rendered directly to HTML from Markdown, but through an intermediate,
Reddit-proprietary document format called RTJSON (&quot;Rich Text JSON&quot;).
This format is designed to be easily consumed and rendered by all
Reddit clients, web and mobile, whereas in Legacy Reddit, mobile
clients had various challenges rendering Markdown content
consistently. Details of the RTJSON format are not currently published
publicly.</p>

<h2>Differences between Legacy Reddit, New-Reddit, and CommonMark</h2>
<p>New-Reddit-flavored Markdown inherits from both Legacy Reddit-flavored
Markdown and CommonMark / GFM, but also differs from both. This
section lists known differences in New-Reddit-flavored Markdown from
Legacy Reddit-flavored Markdown and CommonMark / GFM. It is not
comprehensive.</p>
<p>Differences from Legacy Reddit are often inherited from CommonMark,
while differences from CommonMark are often to support Legacy Reddit
Markdown &quot;quirks&quot;. Differences from either may or may not be
considered bugs, depending on who is doing the considering and when.</p>
<h3>Reddit-specific extensions</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="#spoil">Spoilertext</a> - Spoilertext (<code>&gt;!spoiler!&lt;</code>) is Reddit-specific.</li>
<li><a href="#super">Superscript</a> - There's no superscript standard, and Reddit
has its own syntax which continues to be supported (<code>^</code>, <code>^(...)</code>).</li>
<li><a href="#rlinks">Redditlinks and userlinks</a> - Names of subreddits and
Reddit users, prefixed with <code>/r/</code>, <code>r/</code>, <code>/u/</code>, and <code>u/</code>, are
automatically linked.</li>
<li><a href="#rtm">Rich text media</a> - Reddit supports submissions containing
images, videos, and gifs, and these are encoded into the Markdown
with a customized inline image syntax. This feature is only
supported by the RTE (the &quot;fancy pants&quot; editor) - it would be
prohibitively difficult to write manually at present.</li>
<li>Paragraphs containing only a backslash (<code>\</code>) are empty paragraphs.
This exists to support empty paragraphs in the fancy pants editor.</li>
</ul>
<h3>New features inherited from CommonMark</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="#ol">Ordered lists</a> can be written with parentheses in addition to periods
(<code>1)</code> vs. <code>1.</code>).</li>
<li><a href="#hb">Hard line breaks</a> can be written by terminating lines with
<code>\</code>, in addition to double-space. This syntax is more readable
and less surprising than the double-space syntax.</li>
<li>Nested block elements (like <a href="#lists">lists</a> and <a href="#bq">blockquotes</a> and
<a href="#tables">tables</a>) can be opened on the same line as list items</li>
<li><a href="#code">Code blocks</a> can be written with surrounding fences, instead of
indentation (<code>\</code>``<code>or</code>~~~`). This popular syntax is arguably
more writable and readable than the indentation syntax.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Differences from Legacy Reddit-flavored Markdown</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The parenthesized superscript syntax (<code>^(super duper)</code>) is parsed
more reliably (e.g. superscript containing links works correctly),
and once the legacy parser is phased out, should generally be
preferred to the non-parenthesized (<code>^super</code>) syntax.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Superscript parses slightly differently in corner-cases, e.g.
<code>^(^b)</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiple nested levels of superscript are rendered as a single
level of superscript. This may be fixed in the future.</p>

<p>More than two tildes (<code>~</code>) in <a href="#strike">strikethrough</a> syntax, e.g. <code>a ~~~b~~~ c</code>, are treated differently: in Legacy Reddit the extras are
not consumed, where in New-Reddit they are. Additionally, at the
beginning of a line, in New-Reddit, more than two tildes can be
interpreted as <a href="#code">code fences</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lines containing nothing but hashes (<code>#</code>) are handled differently:
in Legacy Reddit such lines are entirely consumed and not displayed;
in New-Reddit, 6 or fewer hashes are rendered as an empty header,
more than 6 are rendered as a paragraph containing hashes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some corner cases around parsing of links containing spaces,
specifically with respect to their interaction with link titles, are
different.</p>

<h3>Differences from CommonMark / GFM</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Embedded images are not supported in Markdown mode, only in Fancy Pants mode.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Superscript syntax is like snudown, not comrak.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ordered lists must start from &quot;1&quot;. Other start numbers are not supported.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Links can contain spaces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lines containing only hashes (<code>#</code>) are treated differently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Headers do not require spaces after hashes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Headers with more than 6 hashes are parsed differently, as level-6 headers
with hashes in the header text, (e.g. <code>#######valhallaforolaf</code>). In CommonMark,
such constructs are not parsed as headers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A row of table cells can begin with a dash followed by a space,
whereas in CommonMark that would open a new unordered list:</p>
<pre><code>A | B | C
--|---|--
- | e | f
</code></pre>
<p>(Note though that this does not currently apply to the &quot;marker&quot; row that follows
the header row, i.e. the following does not parse as a table,</p>
<pre><code>A | B | C
- | - | -
- | e | f
</code></pre>
<p>whereas it does in Legacy Reddit).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Paragraph content followed by a line that looks like an unordered
list is interpreted as the close of a paragraph and the opening of
an unordered list, whereas snudown continued the paragraph.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="#strike">Strikethrough</a> requires two tildes (<code>~~</code>) per Legacy
Reddit, not one, per CommonMark.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relative links are not supported.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inline HTML is not supported.</p>
