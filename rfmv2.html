<h2>About this document</h2>
<p>Content on Reddit ‚Äî comments, self-posts, and otherwise ‚Äî
is represented as a Reddit-specific variation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>
format, and that format has changed in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/">New Reddit</a>, both in how it is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing">parsed</a> and how it is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendering_(computer_graphics)">rendered</a>. This is a guide to Reddit-flavored
Markdown, explaining generally how to format content on New Reddit,
and specifically identifying areas where New Reddit-flavored Markdown
is different from Old Reddit-flavored markdown.</p>
<p>Those that exclusively submit content via the default &quot;fancy pants&quot;
editor on New Reddit are not exposed to the details described here
‚Äî one does not <em>need</em> to know any of this information to use
Reddit.</p>
<p>Within, examples are presented as pairs showing first how the Markdown
is <strong>written</strong> in the editor, then as it is <strong>rendered</strong>, or presented
on the screen. Important <em>New Reddit notes</em> about differences between
New Reddit-flavored Markdown and Old Reddit-flavored markdown are
called out in italicized paragraphs marked with a crystal ball
(üîÆ), and general <em>tips</em> with the flour-de-lis (‚öúÔ∏è).</p>
<p>For more technical details see <a href="#md">&quot;More about Markdown in Reddit&quot;</a>,
and <a href="#diff">&quot;Differences between Old Reddit Markdown, New Reddit Markdown,
and CommonMark&quot;</a>. Some of the content of this document is
influenced by the previous work of others. See <a href="#cred">&quot;Credits and further
reading&quot;</a> for details and links.</p>

<h2>Where to use Markdown in Reddit</h2>
<p>Markdown content can be submitted in a number of places on Reddit. The
primary uses of Markdown are in a post's <em>self-text</em> (the body of a
text post), and in comments.</p>
<p>In New Reddit when you <a href="https://www.reddit.com/submit">submit</a> a text post or a comment, by default
you are submitting non-Markdown content via the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> &quot;fancy
pants&quot; editor (on desktop at least ‚Äî the story may be different
on mobile platforms). If instead though, on the post submission
screen, you click &quot;Switch to markdown&quot;, then you'll be submitting
Markdown. Users might prefer Markdown over fancy pants for more
precise control over their document, for access to occassional
<a href="#fancy">features that fancy pants doesn't support</a>, or simply by
preference.</p>
<p>Other places that support Markdown include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wikis ‚Äî some subreddits have their own wiki's, and there's a
site-wide wiki.
<ul>
<li>e.g. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/index">https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/index</a></li>
<li>e.g. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq">https://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The subreddit description.</li>
<li>The subreddit submission text (the text that is displayed in Old
Reddit when submitting a post to a particular subreddit).</li>
<li>The New Reddit &quot;text area&quot; sidebar.</li>
<li>Subreddit rules ‚Äî these are displayed in a number of places,
most prominently on the sidebar, but also on other pages.
<ul>
<li>e.g. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/about/rules">https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/about/rules</a></li>
<li>e.g. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/about/sidebar">https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/about/sidebar</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New-style user profiles' &quot;about&quot; text - Presently in beta (with
<a href="https://old.reddit.com/profile-beta-confirmation">opt-in</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>There are significant differences in support of these latter cases
between Old Reddit and New Reddit, the old Markdown parser, and the
new Markdown parser. For details see <a href="#cont">&quot;Differences in content support
between Old Reddit and New Reddit&quot;</a></p>
<a id="syntax"/>
<h2>Reddit-flavored Markdown syntax</h2>
<a id="para"/>
<h3>Paragraphs and line breaks</h3>
<p><em>Paragraphs</em> on Reddit are lines of text separated by blank lines.</p>
<p><strong>Written</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>People think a soul mate is your perfect fit, and that's what
everyone wants. But a true soul mate is a mirror, the person who shows
you everything that is holding you back, the person who brings you to
your own attention so you can change your life.

A true soul mate is probably the most important person you'll ever
meet, because they tear down your walls and smack you awake. But to
live with a soul mate forever? Nah. Too painful. Soul mates, they come
into your life just to reveal another layer of yourself to you, and
then leave.

A soul mate's purpose is to shake you up, tear apart your ego a
little bit, show you your obstacles and addictions, break your heart
open so new light can get in, make you so desperate and out of control
that you have to transform your life, then introduce you to your
spiritual master...

</blockquote>
<a id="hb"/>
<p>Note that <em>line breaks</em> are not displayed ‚Äî that is, adjacent lines
are concatenated together to create a single paragraph. Line breaks
can be added explitly by ending lines with two spaces, or with a
backslash (&quot;\&quot;).</p>
<p><strong>Written</strong>  (<em>note the double spaces</em>):</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>Love is the whole thing.  
We are only pieces.
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Rendered</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Love is the whole thing.<br />
We are only pieces.</p>

<p><strong>Written</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing\
and rightdoing there is a field.\
I'll meet you there.
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Rendered</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing<br />
and rightdoing there is a field.<br />
I'll meet you there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>üîÆ <em><strong>New Reddit note</strong>: Creating linebreaks with backslash only works in
New Reddit. While the backslash is clearer to read and write than two
spaces, if you need compatibility with Old Reddit, prefer two
spaces.</em></p>
<p>Paragraphs are separated by any number of blank lines, and those blank
lines are not themselves rendered, thus one can't add an arbitrary
amount of space between paragraphs simply by adding extra blank lines.</p>
<p><strong>Written</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>Be empty of worrying.\
Think of who created thought!



Why do you stay in prison\
When the door is so wide open?
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Rendered</strong>:</p>

<p>‚öúÔ∏è <em><strong>Tip</strong>: A trick for inserting blanks lines is to create a
paragraph containing nothing but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space">&quot;non-breaking space&quot;</a>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Written</strong>:</p>

<h3>Basic text formatting</h3>
<p><em>Italic</em> text is represented by surrounding text with either a single asterisk (<code>*</code>) or underscore (<code>_</code>).</p>
<p><strong>Written</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>It is *error* only, and not _truth_, that shrinks from inquiry.
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Rendered</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is <em>error</em> only, and not <em>truth</em>, that shrinks from inquiry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Bold</em> text is represented by surrounding text with either double asterisks (<code>**</code>) or double underscores (<code>__</code>).</p>
<p><strong>Written</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>It is **error** only, and not __truth__, that shrinks from inquiry.
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Rendered</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is <strong>error</strong> only, and not <strong>truth</strong>, that shrinks from inquiry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Bold-italic</em> text is represented by surrounding text with either triple asterisks (<code>***</code>) or triple underscores (<code>___</code>).</p>
<p><strong>Written</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>It is ***error*** only, and not ___truth___, that shrinks from inquiry.
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Rendered</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is <em><strong>error</strong></em> only, and not <em><strong>truth</strong></em>, that shrinks from inquiry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that in the previous examples the emphasized words were completely
surrounded by stars or underscores. It is also possible to emphasize
only parts of words, <em>but only with stars</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Written</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>This is totally sub*der*ma**togly**phic.
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Rendered</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is totally sub<em>der</em>ma<strong>togly</strong>phic.</p>
</blockquote>
<a id="strike"/>
<p><em>Strikethrough</em> text is represented by surrounding text with double tildes (<code>~~</code>).</p>
<p><strong>Written</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to
~~love~~ reddit and be ~~loved~~ reddited in return.
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Rendered</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to
<del>love</del> reddit and be <del>loved</del> reddited in return.</p>

<a id="spoil"/>
<p>Spoilers can be hidden as <em>spoilertext</em> by surrounding text with <code>&gt;!</code>
and <code>!&lt;</code>.</p>

<a id="super"/>
<p><em>Superscript</em> is represented by surrounding text in parentheses preceded by a caret (<code>^</code>).</p>
<p><strong>Written</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to
reddit ^(and be reddited in return).
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Rendered</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to
reddit ^(and be reddited in return).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A single word can also be superscripted by preceding it with just a caret.</p>
<p><strong>Written</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to
^reddit and be ^reddited in return.
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Rendered</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to
^reddit and be ^reddited in return.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>üîÆ <em><strong>New Reddit note</strong>: There are significant differences in
the parsing of superscript between Old Reddit and New Reddit. Old
Reddit in particular often failed to parse the parethnesized
superscript syntax reasonably. And New Reddit does not (yet) support
multiple levels of superscript. For superscript compatibility between
Old and New Reddit, stick to the single-word, unparenthesized
superscript syntax and superscript every word, or alternately separate
words with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space">&quot;non-breaking space&quot;</a> HTML entities (<code>&amp;nbsp;</code>).</em></p>

&quot;r/rust&quot;), and user names (&quot;/u/spez&quot; and &quot;u/spez&quot;). The latter are
known as <em>redditlinks</em> and <em>userlinks</em>. Collectively these are known
as <em>autolinks</em>.</p>

<p>‚öúÔ∏è <em><strong>Tip</strong>: Complex URLs can parse in unexpected ways as
autolinks. When you find a URL isn't linking correctly, you can
instead surround the link with angled brackets (<code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>).</em></p>
<p><strong>Written</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>&lt;http://example.com/foo/../bar..&gt;

<p><strong>Rendered</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://example.com/foo/../bar..">http://example.com/foo/../bar..</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Arbitrary text can be explicitly hyperlinked by surrounding it with
square brackets, followed by a URL in parenthesis. The link can
optionally be given a <em>title</em>, which is typically shown by the browser
when the user hovers their mouse over the link.</p>
<p>The title must be surrounded by single quotes, double quotes, or
parenthesis.</p>

<h2>Code blocks and inline code</h2>
<p>There are several ways to represent <em>code</em> in markdown, which is
always rendered in a monospaced font. Though typically called &quot;code&quot;,
this feature is useful for rendering any text as monospaced.</p>
<p>Code is rendered exactly as written ‚Äî no Markdown is
interepreted inside a region of code.</p>
<p>Short code snippets, <em>inline code</em>, can be embedded in paragraphs and
other text, and are delimited by opening and closing backticks (<code>`</code>).</p>

<p>The opening and closing fence must match, both the character used, and
its repetitions.</p>
<p>‚öúÔ∏è <em><strong>Tip</strong>: When inline code itself contains a backtick, or a fenced
code block itself contains a code fence, the interior backticks and
fences can cause the code region to close early. In these cases the
fences can be adjusted to accomodate the code. The rest of this
section is about dealing with corner cases.</em></p>

<p>This is a code fence inside of a code fence (a Markdown code block
containing a Markdown example), and it doesn't render as desired
‚Äî the code inside the interior code fence isn't rendered as code
at all. Instead the code is regular text surrounded by two code
blocks.</p>
<p>This is an easy problem to solve because the code fence syntax has
two different delimiters (<code>`</code>) and (<code>~</code>). Just use more backtics
in the outer code fence, or use the other delimiter.</p>

<p>There's a similar trick for inline code as well: inline code can be
surrounded by any number of backticks, and the opening and closing
must match. So if one needs to put a single backtick inside inline code
they can just surround the code with <em>two</em> backticks, ala
<code>``this thing right here - ` - that's a backtick``</code>.</p>
<p>Of course there's one more tricky case here. What if you inline code
itself needs to begin or end with a backtick, like e.g. you want to
illustrate how to write Markdown inline code within inline code? Just
writing <em>two</em> backticks to open the inline code, then a single
backtick to begin the inline code doesn't work because it looks like
inline code delimited by <em>three</em> backticks: <code>```example of inline code```</code>. If you were to write just that you would lose the interior
backticks:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Written</strong></th>
<th><strong>Rendered</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>```example of inline code```</code></td>
<td><code>example of inline code</code></td>
</tr></tbody></table>
<p>Markdown gives one final escape hatch for these situations: <em>any
space around the inline code is removed</em>, which allows one to write
the inline code delimiters, space, then the textual backtick:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Written</strong></th>
<th><strong>Rendered</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>`` `example of inline code` ``</code></td>
<td><code>`example of inline code`</code></td>
</tr></tbody></table>
<p>This situation admittedly arises most frequently for people writing
Markdown about Markdown ‚Äî you may never encounter it.</p>
<p>Finally, what if you actually <em>want</em> leading or trailing spaces in
your inline code? Well, you are very deep into the weeds ‚Äî if
you actually find yourself in this situation you are probably clever
enough to figure out a workaround.</p>

<h2>Thematic breaks</h2>
<p>The <em>thematic break</em>, a.k.a., the &quot;horizontal rule&quot;, is simply a
horizontal line drawn across the text area. It can be used to create
visual separation between content. A thematic break is written as a
line containing three or more stars (<code>*</code>), dashes (<code>-</code>), or
underscores (<code>_</code>).</p>

<h3>Escaping Markdown syntax</h3>
<p><em>Escaping</em> is a way to tell the parser not to interpret special
characters as Markdown, by preceding them with a backslash, (<code>\</code>).</p>
<p>Sometimes one finds that the parser has interpreted their text in a
way that was unintended. This can happen, for example, if, in the
middle of a paragraph a hyphen begins a new line.</p>
<p><strong>Written</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>I felt my lungs inflate with the onrush of scenery
- air, mountains, trees, people. I thought,
&quot;This is what it is to be happy.
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Rendered</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I felt my lungs inflate with the onrush of scenery</p>
<ul>
<li>air, mountains, trees, people. I thought,
&quot;This is what it is to be happy.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In this case the dash is meant to be part of the text, not the start
of a list. Escaping the dash with a backslash fixes the problem.</p>
<p><strong>Written</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>I felt my lungs inflate with the onrush of scenery
\- air, mountains, trees, people. I thought,
&quot;This is what it is to be happy.
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Rendered</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I felt my lungs inflate with the onrush of scenery
- air, mountains, trees, people. I thought,
&quot;This is what it is to be happy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another common case where the need to escape arises in
with parentheses in links.</p>
<p><strong>Written</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[Parenthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/))
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Rendered</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/">Parenthesis</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is supposed to be a link to the Wikipedia article about
parentheses (&quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/)</a>&quot;), but instead it's a
link to &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/</a>&quot;. Escaping the parenthesis in
the URL causes the parser to not treat it as the closing parethesis of
the link syntax.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>[Parenthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\))
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Rendered</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/)">Parenthesis</a></p>

<h3>HTML entities</h3>
<p>Markdown supports <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Entity">HTML entities</a>, like the relatively common
<code>&amp;nbsp;</code> for &quot;non-breaking space&quot;. These can be an &quot;escape-hatch&quot; to
write difficult-to-represent content. For example, <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> is often
used to insert &quot;empty&quot; paragraphs, providing vertical whitespace where
Markdown doesn't otherwise allow.</p>
<p>In other cases, HTML entities are used to input characters that are
difficult to type, like those above the ASCII range in Unicode, or
characters that have no visual representation.</p>
<p>Some useful examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>A dash is inserted with <code>&amp;mdash;</code>. This is a longer dash than the
typical hyphen, and is the <a href="http://www.thepunctuationguide.com/em-dash.html">correct character for separating clauses
in sentences</a>.</li>
<li>Various <a href="http://jkorpela.fi/chars/spaces.html">non-ASCII whitespace characters</a> can be used to insert
whitespace where otherwise Markdown would not allow it. If you want
to simply enter an arbitrary amount of space between to words you
can e.g. insert multiple &quot;em space&quot; characters (<code>&amp;#x2003;</code>).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tips for robots</h3>
<p>During the transition we've seen some incompatibility arise in the
syntax bots were using. Here are some notes from those experiences, as
well as some general info about automatic posting of Markdown.</p>
<p>This section could use help from bot authors.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In links don't put spaces between the text (<code>[...]</code>) and the URL
(<code>(http://example.com)</code>). This worked in old-Reddit but not
New Reddit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Backslash-escape all parentheses in link URLs (not autolinks), like
<code>[text](http://example.com/foo\(bar)</code>. Parentheses must be balanced
or they will not be parsed as links, so simply escaping all
parentheses is sufficient to make all links with parentheses parse
correctly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternately, use the pointy bracket syntax for link URLs
(<code>[text](&lt;http://example.com&gt;)</code>, which accept unbalanced parens. In
this case though you must URL-escape pointy brackets, as <code>%3C</code> and
<code>%3E</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you post autolinks (raw URLs without the bracket syntax),
consider surrounding them in pointy brackets (<code>&lt;</code> <code>&gt;</code>) and
URL-escaping any pointy brackets within as <code>%3C</code> and <code>%3E</code>. This
will prevent any ambiguity in parsing, particularly at the end of
autolinks. Note that even within brackets autolinks cannot contain
spaces, so URL-escape them as <code>%20</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There's just no way to get away from escaping <em>something</em> while
posting arbitrary links as a bot if you want all URLs to be parsed
as expected. Details of link parsing are <a href="http://commonmark.org/">in the spec</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The new parser and old parser treat HTML-escapes (ala <code>&amp;nbsp;</code>)
differently ‚Äî the old one preserves them, in both text and links;
the new one unescapes them during parsing so that clients (many of
which are not web browsers) aren't exposed to them. This is true
both in text and links, and is specified as such by CommonMark.</p>
<p>The implications of this for bots aren't clear to me at this time,
and I have no recommendations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<a id="rec"/>
<h2>Reddit-flavored Markdown compatibility recommendations</h2>
<p>These are a few recommendations for writing Markdown that is
compatible with Old Reddit markdown parsing (so long as the old
parser remains in use).</p>
<p>Some of the recommendatations are &quot;easy&quot; because they have
equivalents that are as-good in Old Reddit; some are &quot;unfortunate&quot;
because they favor less-nice syntax in sake of compatibility.</p>
<p>Presumably the old parser will be phased out completely at some point
(today it is only used on the old web client ‚Äî mobile clients use the
new), and these recommendations can change.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you don't care about formatting on Old Reddit,
then go ahead and do the opposite of all these suggestions.</p>
<h3>Easy compatibilty recommendations</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use quotes for link titles like <code>[text](http://example.com &quot;title&quot;)</code>
(as opposed to parentheses for link titles).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Begin and end table columns with pipe characters (<code>|</code>). They are
technically optional, but there are occassional surpise parses when
they are not used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delimit ordered lists with dots instead of parens, e.g. (<code>1. foo</code>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Unfortunate compatibility recommendations</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use double spaces instead of backslash to indicate hard line breaks.
Old Reddit only supports double spaces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use indented code blocks instead of code fences. Old Reddit only
supports indented code blocks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't use nested emphasis like <code>_this is __really__ important_</code>.
Doesn't work in Old Reddit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't use multiple levels of superscript (aka &quot;towers&quot;). Doesn't
work in New Reddit, at least not yet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continue using common 'hacks' to make superscript support spaces
like superscripting every word or joining them with exotic unicode
space characters. Avoid the parethesized superscript syntax,
<code>^(...)</code> ‚Äî it often is misparsed in Old Reddit.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>More about Markdown at Reddit</h2>
<p>New Reddit's markdown parser, snoomark, is a variation of
<a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/">GitHub-flavored Markdown (GFM)</a>, based on <a href="http://commonmark.org/">CommonMark</a>, with the
GFM table and autolink extensions, as well as a modified
strikethrough extension. It also includes Reddit-specific extensions,
and Reddit-specific compatibility quirks that deviate from CommonMark.</p>
<p>snoomark is a downstream project of <a href="https://github.com/kivikakk/comrak">comrak</a>, which is in turn a
re-implementation of <a href="https://github.com/github/cmark">cmark-gfm</a>, GitHub's CommonMark implementation
with GitHub extensions (GFM), which is in turn downstream of <a href="https://github.com/commonmark/cmark">cmark</a>,
the CommonMark reference implementation. snoomark itself is not (yet)
open source, but changes to comrak are regularly merged into snoomark.</p>
<p>During the transition from Old Reddit to New Reddit, the philosophy
around Markdown support has fluctuated ‚Äî originally, the plan was to
move to something approaching CommonMark and drop all compatibility
with old Reddit &quot;quirks&quot;; but as the rollout proceeded, and without
a firm transition story, that position softened, and a number of
compatibility quirks were added to the new parser.</p>
<p>At this time it is not expected that many further compatibility quirks
will be added to New Reddit: it's more likely that the old parser
will be completely removed in favor of the new parser, leaving both
Old Reddit and New Reddit using the new syntax. In that scenario,
there will be some amount (hopefully small) of old content that no
longer renders correctly due to parsing differences.</p>
<p>Future directions though will continue to be evaluated as the rollout
continues and bugs are reported.</p>
<p>Markdown rendering in New Reddit is notably different from Old
Reddit, and from most Markdowwn-consuming websites, in that it is not
rendered directly to HTML from Markdown, but through an intermediate,
Reddit-proprietary document format called RTJSON (&quot;Rich Text JSON&quot;).
This format is designed to be easily consumed and rendered by all
Reddit clients, web and mobile, whereas in Old Reddit, mobile
clients had various challenges rendering Markdown content
consistently. Details of the RTJSON format are currently unpublished.</p>
<a id="rat"/>
<h2>Rationale for transitioning to CommonMark</h2>
<p>The new parser was created because the old parser was unmaintainable,
security-critical C code. Adding new features to it was so
prohibitively difficult that effectively nobody was willing to make
changes, nor take responsibility for reviewing changes. The new parser
is not written in C and so is more maintainable. Furthermore, the
redesign called for new features and the future ability to add new
features. Examples are spoilertext (which was added to the C parser
for feature parity, took a year to review and merge, and ended up
somewhat broken after all that; it will likely never be fixed because
of the risk of introducing security bugs with every change. Likewise
superscript parsing in legacy Reddit is poor and nobody has ever dared
try to fix it); rich text media (the new embedding of images and
videos into RTE posts); rendering to Reddit's new platform-independent
JSON-based document format instead of directly to HTML; the
backwards-compatibility hacks to support some legacy quirks; the
general stream of bugfixes that have gone into the new parser.</p>
<p>Development velocity on the old parser was effectively 0. The new
parser receives changes regularly, and most changes don't require a
security review.</p>
<p>The redesign was also an opportunity to upgrade Reddit's ancient
markdown dialect to a modern standards-based CommonMark dialect, where
it can receive the benefits of ongoing upstream development and
standards work, and catch up with approximately 6 years of Markdown's
evolution (whereas Reddit's parser was stagnant). This decision of
course has resulted in many complaints that certain Old Reddit
syntaxes don't work in New Reddit, but we have gradually added
backcompat quirks for some of them.</p>
<p>New Reddit Markdown further receives several new niceties inherited
from CommonMark, most notable being line breaks with terminmating <code>\</code>
and code blocks demarcated by fences instead of indents. During the
transition period of course those aren't compatible with Old
Reddit, but eventually we would expect them to be 'safe' to use without
worrying too much about compatibility ‚Äî the mobile clients already
understand the new parser's output, it's just the old web client
that doesn't (yet).</p>
<p>Probably the only serious alternative to upgrading to CommonMark would
have been to do a complete rewrite of the old parser in a safe
language, preserving all the Reddit-specific quirks. Presumably that
was not seen as desirable, both because of the effort required, and
because it would have suited nobody but Reddit ‚Äî in the long run
behaving more like CommonMark will provide a more seamless experience
for those using CommonMark elsewhere, mostly those who are technically
adept, since the vast majority of New Reddit users are using the fancy
pants editor. Now Reddit is able to participate in the upstream
CommonMark community (and has already affected upstream
implementations and the standard). And again, the combination of a
maintainable codebase, and having a standard to conform to, means
Reddit can keep it's parser up to date with standards as they evolve.</p>

<h2>Differences between Old Reddit Markdown, New Reddit Markdown, and CommonMark</h2>
<p>New Reddit-flavored Markdown inherits from both Old Reddit-flavored
Markdown and CommonMark / GFM, but also differs from both. This
section lists known differences in New Reddit-flavored Markdown from
Old Reddit-flavored Markdown and CommonMark / GFM. It is not
comprehensive.</p>
<p>Differences from Old Reddit are often inherited from CommonMark.
Note that for those who wish to support Old Reddit users, one may
choose not to use these features. See also <a href="#rec">&quot;Reddit-flavored
Markdown compatibility recommendations&quot;</a>.
Differences from CommonMark are often to support Old Reddit
Markdown &quot;quirks&quot;. Differences from either may or may not be
considered bugs, depending on who is doing the considering and when.</p>
<h3>Reddit-specific extensions</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="#spoil">Spoilertext</a> ‚Äî Spoilertext (<code>&gt;!spoiler!&lt;</code>) is Reddit-specific.</li>
<li><a href="#super">Superscript</a> ‚Äî There's no superscript standard, and Reddit
has its own syntax which continues to be supported (<code>^</code>, <code>^(...)</code>).</li>
<li><a href="#rlinks">Redditlinks and userlinks</a> ‚Äî Names of subreddits and
Reddit users, prefixed with <code>/r/</code>, <code>r/</code>, <code>/u/</code>, and <code>u/</code>, are
automatically linked.</li>
<li><a href="#rtm">Rich text media</a> ‚Äî Reddit supports submissions containing
images, videos, and gifs, and these are encoded into the Markdown
with a customized inline image syntax. This feature is only
supported by the RTE (the &quot;fancy pants&quot; editor) ‚Äî it would be
prohibitively difficult to write manually at present.</li>
<li>Paragraphs containing only a zero-width space (<code>&amp;#x200b;</code>) are empty
paragraphs. This exists to support the fancy pants editor.</li>
</ul>
<h3>New features inherited from CommonMark</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="#ol">Ordered lists</a> can be written with parentheses in addition to periods
(<code>1)</code> vs. <code>1.</code>).</li>
<li><a href="#hb">Hard line breaks</a> can be written by terminating lines with
<code>\</code>, in addition to double-space. This syntax is more readable
and less surprising than the double-space syntax.</li>
<li>Nested block elements (like <a href="#lists">lists</a> and <a href="#bq">blockquotes</a> and
<a href="#tables">tables</a>) can be opened on the same line as list items</li>
<li><a href="#code">Code blocks</a> can be written with surrounding fences, instead of
indentation (<code>\</code>``<code>or</code>~~~`). This popular syntax is arguably
more writable and readable than the indentation syntax.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Differences from Old Reddit-flavored Markdown</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The parenthesized superscript syntax (<code>^(super duper)</code>) is parsed
more reliably (e.g. superscript containing links works correctly),
and once the old parser is phased out, should generally be
preferred to the non-parenthesized (<code>^super</code>) syntax.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Superscript parses slightly differently in corner-cases, e.g.
<code>^(^b)</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiple nested levels of superscript are rendered as a single
level of superscript. This may be fixed in the future.</p>

<h3>Differences from CommonMark / GFM</h3>
<ul>

</li>
<li>
<p>Headers with more than 6 hashes are parsed differently, as level-6 headers
with hashes in the header text, (e.g. <code>#######valhallaforolaf</code>). In CommonMark,
such constructs are not parsed as headers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A row of table cells can begin with a dash followed by a space,
whereas in CommonMark that would open a new unordered list:</p>
<pre><code>A | B | C
--|---|--
- | e | f
</code></pre>
<p>(Note though that this does not currently apply to the &quot;marker&quot; row that follows
the header row, i.e. the following does not parse as a table,</p>
<pre><code>A | B | C
- | - | -
- | e | f
</code></pre>
<p>whereas it does in Old Reddit).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Paragraph content followed by a line that looks like an unordered

an unordered list, whereas snudown continued the paragraph.</p>

Reddit, not one, per CommonMark.</p>

<h2>Differences in content support between Old Reddit and New Reddit</h2>
<p>The <a href="#where">&quot;Where to use Markdown syntax&quot;</a> section described the
specific features of Reddit that accept Markdown as input. Sadly, as
of yet there are significant differences in support of these various
cases between Old Reddit and New Reddit, the old Markdown parser and
the new Markdown parser.</p>
<p>Here are the dirty details.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>selftext</em> ‚Äî While New Reddit uses the new Markdown
parser/renderer to render selftext in most places, including on that
post's own page, and in the &quot;lightbox&quot; (the popup that appears upon
clicking a post in the listing page), it uses the <em>old</em> Markdown
parser in the listing previews, both in the default cardview, and in
the &quot;expando&quot; (the details that open after clicking the icon with
two opposing arrows) in classic view.</li>
<li><em>wikis</em> ‚Äî Presently only rendered via Old Reddit.</li>
<li><em>subreddit description</em> ‚Äî Not rendered with Markdown in
New Reddit. Furthermore, the formerly multiline content is restricted
to a single line.</li>
<li><em>subreddit submission text</em> ‚Äî Not rendered at all in New Reddit.</li>
<li><em>New Reddit's &quot;text area&quot; sidebar</em> ‚Äî Uses Old Reddit's renderer.</li>
<li><em>subreddit rules</em> ‚Äî Rendered with Old Reddit's renderer even
in New Reddit.</li>
<li><em>new-style user profiles' &quot;about&quot; text</em> ‚Äî Always rendered
with the Old Reddit renderer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these cause incompatibilities between content in Old Reddit
and New Reddit, and should probably considered bugs, but are not
necessarily being tracked or worked on.</p>
<a id="fancy"/>
<h2>Differences between fancy pants and Markdown</h2>
<p>The fancy pants WYSIWIG editor supports most Markdown features that
Reddit supports generally, but it has some limitations. Under the
hood, fancy pants stores its documents as Markdown, but its interface
does not support all Markdown features Reddit supports generally.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>HTML entities cannot be entered into fancy pants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fancy pants has much lower &quot;nesting limits&quot; than raw Markdown.
Nesting limits impact the depth that nested lists and blockquotes
are allowed to create in the document.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Media like images and videos can be embedded in content via the
fancy pants editor but not in raw markdown.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fancy pants only supports a single heading level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fancy pants does not support putting arbitrary <em>block elements</em> like
lists, blockquotes, and tables, inside lists or blockquotes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fancy pants does not support link reference definitions ‚Äî
repeated links must be inserted repeatedly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fancy pants does not support hard line breaks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fancy pants is able to create blank lines, whereas Markdown cannot.
It does this with a backwards-compatible hack by inserting
paragraphs containing a single zero-width space (<code>&amp;#x200b;</code>), which
the Markdown parser later converts to an empty paragraph. Technically,
Markdown authors can do the same trick.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though the submission page has the option to switch between fancy
pants and Markdown modes, be wary of switching from Markdown to fancy
pants. Although switching from fancy pants to Markdown is expected
to be lossless, the reverse is not true. E.g. if your Markdown
contains HTML entities, they will be converted to plain Unicode during
the conversion; deeply nested lists will be lost, etc. Furthermore,
upon switching <em>back</em> to Markdown from fancy pants, the exact Markdown
you entered will be lost, replaced by Markdown generated by fancy
pants.</p>

<h2>Contributing to this document</h2>
<p>TODO</p>
<p>Try to stick to conventions established herein:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most sections introduce a new Markdown <em>concept</em> by name, and the
first mention is <em>italicised</em> as in &quot;section <em>headings</em> have six
levels&quot;.</li>
<li>Examples as pairs of &quot;written&quot; and &quot;rendered&quot;, either in table format
(when possible) or in succeeding paragraphs and blockquotes, following
the existing formatting conventions.</li>
<li>&quot;Tips&quot; and &quot;New Reddit notes&quot; called out where narratively appropriate,
using existing emoji and formatting conventions.</li>
<li>Employ <code>&amp;mdash;</code> where appropriate ‚Äî don't just use hyphens.</li>
<li>Refer consistently to legacy/r2 Reddit as &quot;Old Reddit&quot;; to the
redesign as &quot;New Reddit&quot;.</li>
<li>Consistently Captialize &quot;Reddit&quot;, &quot;Markdown&quot;, &quot;CommonMark&quot;.</li>
<li>Two blank lines between sections for easier scanning of the source.</li>
</ul>
<p>It would be super helpful for someone to occassionally run a pass over
the whole document updating out-of-date info, then bumping the
&quot;current as of&quot; date at the very top of the document.</p>
<h2>TODO</h2>
<ul>
<li>replace para example with something less opinionated</li>
<li>replace aeschylus examples with ones less pretentious</li>
<li>simple superscript can superscript links with spaces (not yet CREATE-2474)</li>
<li>add comment hack with empty links?</li>
</ul>
